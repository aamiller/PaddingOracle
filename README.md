# PaddingOracle
Source code for a Padding Oracle attack demonstration - vulnerable API and cracking code. C#, ASP .NET

This was written after a hacking challenge (CTF / "Hackathon") at work.

Build the WebAPI project, then run it without debugging, so that you can then debug the PadOracle project against it.

Change the string as you want, to discover how well it does/doesn't work. Try to throw the algorithm off.

See if there are any optimisations you can think of. It's still very slow, perhaps.
